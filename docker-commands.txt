I used the Docker commands that we learned in the section.. which are :

        1. docker-compose down
        Stop all running containers from Compose and clean the default network

        2. docker-compose up --build -d
        Run the project from scratch, build the image, and start containers in the background

            After running this command, I tried to run the project even though I had deleted MongoDB from my laptop, and it worked
            here: http://localhost:3000

        3. docker ps -a
        List all containers (running and stopped) with their names and status

        4. docker exec -it task3_bigdata bash
        Enter the container to run Node commands or check files

        5. docker logs -f task3_bigdata
        Follow the container logs live

        6. docker build -t my-node-app .
        Rebuild the Node app image only without Compose if code or Dockerfile changed


I also made the "Dockerfile" and used volumes in the "Docker Compose" to enable hot reload and keep data persistent.
